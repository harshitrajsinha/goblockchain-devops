# ⛓️ Go Blockchain & Wallet System

A minimal, educational implementation of a **decentralized Proof-of-Work blockchain** and a **web-based wallet system** built in **Go**.  
This project demonstrates blockchain fundamentals from scratch, including **block creation**, **transaction signing**, and a **simple peer-to-peer consensus mechanism**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Decentralized Node**:  
  The `blockchain_server` acts as a full node that can mine new blocks and synchronize with peers.

- **Proof-of-Work (PoW)**:  
  A mining algorithm secures the network by requiring computational effort to create new blocks.

- **Cryptographic Wallets**:  
  The `wallet` package handles secure generation of **ECDSA key pairs** and **Base58Check-style blockchain addresses**.

- **Transaction Management**:  
  Users can create and sign transactions, which are broadcast across the network.

- **RESTful API**:  
  Both blockchain and wallet servers expose APIs for communication.

- **Web UI**:  
  The `wallet_server` provides a basic interface to create wallets, view balances, and send transactions.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites
- [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) (v1.20+ recommended)

### 🛠 Setup

Clone the repository and initialize dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dkv204p/goblockchain.git
cd goblockchain
go mod tidy
````

## ▶️ Running the System

You need to run both the **blockchain server** and the **wallet server** in separate terminals.

Use .env.example to set .env

### 1️⃣ Start the Blockchain Server

Set `BLOCKCHAIN_SERVER_PORT` value in .env (if not set default port will be 5000)

```bash
go run ./blockchain_server
```
Note down the BLOCKCHAIN_SERVER host

* Runs a blockchain node
* Begins mining automatically
* Searches for other nodes

### 2️⃣ Start the Wallet Server

Set `WALLET_SERVER_PORT` value in .env (if not set default port will be 8080)

Set `BLOCKCHAIN_SERVER_HOST` value in .env (based on value of BLOCKCHAIN_SERVER host of previous step, if not set default host will be http://127.0.0.1)

```bash
go run ./wallet_server
```

* Starts the wallet’s web server
* Connects to the blockchain node

### 3️⃣ Access the Wallet UI

Open your browser:
👉 [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080)

---

## 💰 How to Use the Wallet

1. **Get Funds (Mine a Block)**

   * New wallets start with `0` balance.
   * Trigger mining:
     [http://127.0.0.1:5000/mine](http://127.0.0.1:5000/mine)
   * A reward (`1.0`) is added to your balance.

2. **Send a Transaction**

   * Run another wallet server on a different port:

     ```bash
     go run . --port=8081 --gateway="http://127.0.0.1:5000"
     ```
   * Copy the new wallet’s address.
   * In the first wallet, paste it into the **Address** field → enter amount → click **Send**.

3. **Confirm the Transaction**

   * The transaction will be **pending**.
   * Mine another block (`/mine`) to confirm it.
   * The recipient’s balance updates.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* **Persistence**: Use a database (e.g., BoltDB, SQLite) for blockchain & transaction pool storage.
* **Advanced Consensus**: Replace longest-chain rule with **authenticated gossip protocol** or other consensus.
* **Transaction Fees**: Introduce miner rewards via fees.
* **Security Enhancements**: Harden against attacks (input parsing, overflows, etc.).
